###<p align="left">**NYC Planimetric Database** </p>

####Purpose<br>
This document is intended to provide a dual purpose. For the capture of the specific planimetric features, this document provides the rules for capture. Under what conditions features are captured, how they are captured and what exceptions apply. Since this document provides a wealth of information that would also benefit users working with the data, we decided to spend a bit more time formatting and presenting this document to further function as a secondary source of documentation. This document is not intended to replace the metadata included with the planimetric features but as a supplement. Lastly, this document orginated from previous planimetric updates that have evolved and been refined over each successive update and will be extended and maintained over the course of future updates.
<br>
####Introduction<br>
One of the core functions of the NYC Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) GIS group is to maintain and distribute an accurate 'basemap' for NYC. Collectively, the basemap includes the digitial orthophotography and planimetric features. The basemap provides the foundation upon which virtually all other geospatial data within New York government is registered. Ensuring its completeness and accuracy is fundamental to the Group’s core mission.
<br>
####Background<br>
Planimetric mapping is the capture of geographic features from aerial survey (i.e., capture of aerial photography). Planimetrics are traditionally mapped in two dimensions and therefore are exclusive of elevation.  Quite simply planimetrics are the visible features that can be digitized from aerial photography. The planimetric database is composed of individual features each repressenting a different geographic or human-made phenomena. In their sum total, the planimetrics represent the base map for New York City.
<br>
####Currency<br>
The source imagery for the current planimetric update was captured on the following dates: 
<br>
• Manhattan - June 24, 2014<br>
• The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island - April 1st through April 25th, 2014<br>
• Final delivery of all imagery – April 10, 2015<br>

Based on models developed from the raw imagery and aerotriangulation, the planimetric features were updated, and in some cases captured new, for the entire City. The project began March 2015 and was completed February 2016.

# Imagery and Data Specifications
Digital planimetrics were derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2014 New York Statewide Flyover (see Introduction for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. The images were captured with 80% forward lap and side lap to support 1”=100’ mapping and meet the distortion free requirements within New York City. Planimetrics are developed to meet American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Class 1 (one) horizontal mapping standards and ASPRS vertical Class 2 (two) accuracy specifications. Planimetrics are delivered via an ESRI geodatabase in New York State Plane Coordinates, Long Island East Zone, NAD83, US foot.

### Subtype: BUILDING

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery.<br><br>Used an <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Building-Footprints/tb92-6tj8">existing DoITT building database</a> for reference and for BIN values. For more information regarding BIN, see [Building Footprint Attributes](#building-footprint-attributes). |
| **Features Captured** | All buildings with well-defined walls and roofs that are >400 square feet and taller than 12 feet were captured.<br><br>Buildings with <12 feet height but with BIN were captured.<br><br>Buildings with BIN but <400 square feet were also captured. |
| **Capture Notes** | Buildings with flat roofs were captured on roof outline, capturing the largest outline (excluding overhangs, awnings, construction features, etc.).<br><br>Buildings with pitched roofs were captured on the building footprint.<br><br>Carports, when attached to main building, were included in the outline. Interior divisions within buildings were not captured (used existing building layer and BIN as guide).<br><br>Parcel data and BIN was used as guidance for collection. Where the parcel data indicated that a building should be two or more geometries AND there was NO physical indication, the building was split using the parcel lines. Where the parcel data indicated that a building should be two or more geometries AND there was a physical indication, the building was split using the physical indications. If an existing building was split into several new buildings, the original BIN was retained in only one of the new buildings (ideally the largest) and the new buildings were assigned an "even million" BIN (as a placeholder). BINs can not be duplicated. <br><br>Building Footprints abutting one another on a single tax lot, but each having a unique BIN, were flagged and verified during review.<br><br>If a building was demolished (i.e., as evidenced in the imagery), the BIN was also deleted and was not used for any new building geometry.<br><br>Small triangles denote a permit is out to construct a new building at the location.  These small triangles were added by DoITT building editors. These triangles should be removed when new buildings are added. Therefore if a new building was constructed in the new orthos, the building was captured,  the attributes from triangle to building were transferred to the new building, and the triangle was deleted. If no new building was visible on the orthos, the triangles were left in the data.<br><br>An “even million" BIN was assigned to buildings not existing in the source database.<br><br>For more information regarding BIN, see [Building Footprint Attributes](#building-footprint-attributes). |
| **Features Excluded** | The following features were not captured:<br>•  temporary trailers, tents, or roofs at gas stations (over pumps).<br>• roofs (overhang) to gas stations, unless connected to building.<br>• movable jet bridge for access to aircraft.<br>• awnings, scaffolds, or sidewalk sheds. |

For more information regarding BIN, see [Building Footprint Attributes](#building-footprint-attributes).<br><br>Used DOF TaxMap as a reference. |
| **Features Captured** | All garages were captured, regardless of size.  To be considered a garage, the structure must have a driveway (paved or unpaved) for road  access, and be able to store one or more cars. |
| **Capture Notes** | Special care was applied to ensure sheds were not confused with garages. In general, standard dimensions for detached garages are approximately 12’x20’ or 14’x20’.<br><br>The Parcel layer was used to place garages within parcel or at parcel boundary – being sure to check for special cases where parcel boundary clearly crosses a garage. In these cases, either the garage was split using physical features, or the property line was used where there was no distinguishing physical feature.<br><br>An “even million" BIN was assigned to garages not existing in the source database. For more information regarding BIN, see [Building Footprint Attributes](#building-footprint-attributes). |
| **Features Excluded** | Small tool or storage sheds in backyards which have no visible car access were not captured. |

| **DOITT_ID** | Unique numeric ID assigned by DoITT.  |
| **LAST_STATUS_DATE** | Most recent date that a building status was changed. |
| **HEIGHT_ROOF** | Building Height is calculated as the difference from the building elevation from the Elevation point feature class and the elevation in the interpolated TIN model. This value then is the height of the roof above the ground elevation, NOT its height above sea level. |
| **DOB_JOB_NUM** | Job number from DOB_JOB table obtained from milestone reports.  |
| **NUM_FLOORS** | Number of full and partial stories, starting from the ground floor as derived from PLUTO. If a lot has more than one building, the number of stories in the primary building on the tax lot is applied to all buildings on the lot.|
| **BUILT_CODE** | A code indicating whether the year the building was built (CONSTRUCTION_YEAR) was an estimate. E = Estimate Blank = Year Built is not an Estimate |<br>

# MEDIAN

**Geometry Type:** Polygon

**Subtypes:** [Median_Painted](#subtype-median_painted), [Median_Curb](#subtype-median_curb), [Median_Rail](#subtype-median_rail), [Median_Fence](#subtype-median_fence), [Median_Grass](#subtype-median_grass), and [Median_Barrier](#subtype-median_barrier)

[**Attributes**](#median-attributes)<br>

*Rule: Medians were not intersected by <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> on the same road except in some rare occasions (e.g. at street intersections with medians). Median type hierarchy is as follows: barrier, rail, fence, curb, grass and painted.*<br>
<br>
### General Guidelines for Medians

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery and existing planimetrics. |
| **Features Captured** | All medians that physically divide a roadbed were collected; which includes medians, traffic islands, "Jersey Barriers", and painted areas that are used to separate traffic flow. |
| **Capture Notes** | Medians are sometimes paved, are normally elevated (have a curb), or have dirt or grass.<br><br>Medians can have sidewalks crossing them. In those cases, the outline of the largest area was incorporated into a single median feature.<br><br>The NYC online <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bike-Routes/umu5-zyd3">Bike Routes</a> data was used as a reference to identify potential new medians. Areas where the column ALLCLASSES is equal to I and "I,II" most often contained new medians. New Medians exist throughout the City regardless of these bike lane classifications. Thus, this was considered a supplemental source only. |
| **Features Excluded** | The following features were not captured as medians:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Barriers in front of buildings,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Jersey Barriers used to regulate traffic in construction areas, or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Jersey Barriers used to block-off road access. |<br><br>

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery and existing planimetrics. |
| **Features Captured** | All parking lots (paved or unpaved) greater than 2,000 sq. feet.<br><br>Parking areas adjacent to the travel-way and separated from the travel-way by a curb or other obstruction were captured as parking lots. In these cases, the [Roadbed](#roadbed) and [Pavement Edge](#pavement-edge) end or wrap around the parking lot. The parking lot is not included as part of the Roadbed. |
| **Capture Notes** | These features connect to road edge ([Curb](#curb) or [Edge of Pavement](#subtype-edge-of-pavement)) only at entrances and exits. |

### Subtype: EDGE OF PAVEMENT

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery, existing planimetrics, and Parks database. |
| **Features Captured** | Updated all segments between pavement and other surfaces or features (i.e. Curbs, sidewalks, or grass).  |
| **Capture Notes** | Each segment was captured as a continuous feature across a blockface (typically from one intersection to the next – along that side of the road). <br><br>The vertex between two segments was often located at the street corner. Edge of Pavement features are continuous across driveways, alleys, or access to parking. The one exception to this rule is where a street segment changes names (as determined by <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> Centerline names) outside of any street intersections.  In these cases, the existing CSCL break (node) was used to create corresponding breaks in Pavement Edge segments.<br><br>For cul-de-sacs, two segments were created. The CSCL centerline was used to define the breakpoints of the Pavement Edge segments.<br><br>Dead end streets were terminatde where the tax map crosses the road.  Two segments were created on left and right sides of CSCL.<br><br>On highways, Pavement Edge corresponds to the ‘roadbed’ sub-feature class in [Roadbed](#roadbed), and does not include the shoulder. |

1. [Capture Rule for missing CSCL](#1-blockfaceid-conflation-from-pavement-edge-to-cscl---rule-for-missing-cscl)<br>
2. [Capture Rule for Medians](#2-blockfaceid-conflation-from-pavement-edge-to-cscl---rules-for-medians)<br>
3. [Capture Rule for Multiple CSCL with Single Pavement Edge](#3-blockfaceid-conflation-from-pavement-edge-to-cscl----rule-for-multiple-cscl-segments-with-a-single-pavement-edge)<br>
4. [Capture Rule for Multiple PavementEdge with single CSCL segment](#4-blockfaceid-conflation-from-pavement-edge-to-cscl---rule-for-multiple-pavement-edge-with-single-cscl-segment)<br>
5. [Capture Rule for handling complex intersection/median/bridge scenarios](#5-blockfaceid-conflation-from-pavement-edge-to-cscl---rule-for-handling-complex-intersectionmedianbridge-scenarios)

<br>
#####1. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for missing CSCL

• If no <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> feature existed on an existing roadbed with Pavement Edge, the production team broke down the Pavement Edge as needed on the approximated center of where a CSCL Centerline.  The team then assigned Left and Right (L/R) BlockfaceIDs to the Pavement Edge.  However, these BlockfaceIDs were not conflated to any CSCL segments (and these Pavement Edge features were flagged as having a BlockfaceID that was not conflated to CSCL).<br>

**The following are examples of where CSCL is missing and PavementEdge exists.**

<br>

#####2. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rules for Medians

• When a <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> segment is bounded on one or both sides by a median, the longest edges of median Pavement Edge was assigned BlockfaceIDs, which were conflated onto applicable adjacent CSCL segments.<br>
• Assigned BlockfaceIDs to Pavement Edge for all medians except painted medians.<br>
• Conflated to CSCL where no Pavement Edge derived BlockfaceID takes priority, and there was a CSCL segment that corresponds to the long edge of the median.<br>
• In cases where medians are within medians, the conflating median is the majority (containing) median.<br>
• Pavement Edge features on a median were flagged as having a BlockfaceID that was not conflated to CSCL.<br>

<br>

#####3. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL -  Rule for Multiple CSCL Segments with a Single Pavement Edge

• In cases where there are multiple <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> segments running along a single Pavement Edge (median or otherwise), the BlockfaceID from the Pavement Edge was conflated to the CSCL segments that correspond to the single Pavement Edge.<br>

<br><p align="center">![PE_Diagram_3](Images/FeatureViews/PE_Diagram_3.png)</p> 

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<br>

#####4. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for Multiple Pavement Edge with single CSCL segment

• In cases where multiple Pavement Edge segments span a single <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a> (median or otherwise), only the BlockfaceID from the Pavement Edge closest to the CSCL segment midpoint was transferred to CSCL.  The other BlockfaceIDs were not conflated to CSCL. An attribute was added to the Pavement Edge database that indicates whether or not each BlockfaceID had been associated with a CSCL segment.<br>

<br><p align="center">![PE_Diagram_4_1](Images/FeatureViews/PE_Diagram_4_1.png)</p> 

<br><p align="center">![PE_Diagram_4_2](Images/FeatureViews/PE_Diagram_4_2.png)</p> 

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<br>

#####5. BlockfaceID conflation from Pavement Edge to CSCL - Rule for handling complex intersection/median/bridge scenarios

• In cases of complex intersections with multiple medians and/or elevated roadways/bridges, each level was evaluated individually (i.e., at grade, elevated, etc.) in order to logically determine the appropriate break points on medians and to assign BlockfaceIDs to the correct <a href="https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b/about">CSCL</a>. The use of Pavement Edge’s polylineZ information and the use of CSCL’s “level codes” were used to determine which features are on the same vertical plane.<br>
• Only the “straight edges” of medians were assigned to CSCL segments.  Small corner segments for triangular medians were not created.<br>

**The screenshot below shows an example of a “complex” intersection.**

<br><p align="center">![PE_Diagram_5_1](Images/FeatureViews/PE_Diagram_5_1.png)</p> 
<br>
**The screenshot below is the same intersection, but showing only the “at grade” centerlines and Pavement Edgs/Median features. Arrows have been included to depict the assignment of L/R BlockfaceIDs for the “at grade” segments in this intersection.**
