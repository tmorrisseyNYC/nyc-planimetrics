####Introduction<br>
A primary goal of the NYC Citywide GIS is to maintain the accuracy and quality of the base data which includes the orthophotography and planimetrics, collectively known as NYC Map. This base is the foundation upon which virtually all other GIS information within the City of New York is built. Ensuring its completeness and accuracy is fundamental to the Group’s core mission. 
<br><br>
The source imagery was captured on the following dates: <br>• Manhattan - June 24, 2014<br>• The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island - April 1st through April 25th, 2014<br>• Final delivery of all imagery – April 10, 2015<br><br>Using this orthoimagery, the planimetric base layers were updated citywide starting in March 2015 and were completed in February 2016.

# Imagery and Data Specifications
Digital planimetrics were derived using the imagery products delivered with the 2014 New York Statewide Flyover (see Introduction for specific flight dates), which includes raw imagery collected to support the generation of 0.5 Ft Ground Sample Distance (GSD) natural color imagery. The images were captured with 80% forward lap and side lap to support 1”=100’ mapping and meet the distortion free requirements within New York City. Planimetrics are developed to meet American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Class 1 (one) horizontal mapping standards and ASPRS vertical Class 2 (two) accuracy specifications. Planimetrics are delivered via an ESRI geodatabase in New York State Plane Coordinates, Long Island East Zone, NAD83, US foot.

# Building Footprints

**Type: Polygon**

**Includes the following structures:** [Building](#subtype-building), [Garage](#subtype-garage), [Under Construction Unknown](#subtype-building-uc-building-under-construction), and [Skybridge](#subtype-skybridge)

### Subtype: BUILDING

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery.<br><br>Used existing building database for reference and for BIN values. |
| **Features Captured** | All buildings with well-defined walls and roofs that are >400 sq. feet and taller than 12 feet were captured.<br><br>Buildings with <12 feet height but with BIN were captured.<br>Buildings with BIN but <400 sq. feet were also captured. |
| **Capture Notes** | Buildings with flat roofs were captured on roof outline, capturing the largest outline (excluding overhangs, awnings, construction features, etc.).<br><br>Buildings with pitched roofs were captured on the building footprint.<br><br>Carports, when attached to main building, were included in the outline. Do not collect interior divisions within buildings were not captured (used existing building layer and BIN as guide).<br><br>Parcel data and BIN was used as guidance for collection. Where the parcel data indicated that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is NO physical indication, the building was split using the parcel lines. Where the parcel data indicated that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is a physical indication, the building was split using the physical indications. If an existing building was split into several new buildings, the original BIN was retained in only one of the new buildings (ideally the largest) and the new buildings were assigned an "even million" BIN (as a placeholder). BINS can not be duplicated. <br><br>Building footprints that are adjacent, have different BINS and are on one tax lot were flagged and verified during review.<br><br>If a building was demolished (i.e., if the building had a different shape in the imagery), the BIN was also deleted and was not used for any new building geometry.<br><br>Small triangles denote a permit is out to construct a new building at the location.  These small triangles were added by DoITT building editors. These triangles should be removed when new buildings are added. Therefore if a new building was constructed in the new orthos, the building was captured,  the attributes from triangle to building were transferred to the new building, and the triangle was deleted. If no new building was visible on the orthos, the triangles were left in the data. |
| **Features Excluded** | The following features were not captured:<br>•  temporary trailers, tents, or roofs at gas stations (over pumps).<br>• roofs (overhang) to gas stations, unless connected to building.<br>• movable jet bridge for access to aircraft.<br>• awnings, scaffolds, or sidewalk sheds. |

### Subtype: GARAGE

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery.<br><br>Used existing building database for reference and for BIN values.<br><br>Used DOF TaxMapas a reference. |
| **Features Captured** | All garages were captured, regardless of size.  To be considered a garage, the structure must have a driveway (paved or unpaved) for road  access, and be able to store one or more cars. |
| **Capture Notes** | Special care was applied to ensure sheds were not confused with garages. In general, standard dimensions for detached garages are approximately 12’x20’ or 14’x20’.<br><br>The Parcel layer was used to place garages within parcel or at parcel boundary – being sure to check for special cases where parcel boundary clearly crosses a garage. In these cases, either the garage was split using physical features, or the property line was used where there was no distinguishing physical feature.<br><br>In cases where there was no BIN for the garage, an "even million” BIN was assigned as follows:<br>• 1000000 for Manhattan,<br>• 2000000 for Bronx,<br>• 3000000 for Brooklyn,<br>• 4000000 for Queens,<br>• 5000000 for Staten Island |
| **Features Excluded** | Small tool or storage sheds in backyards which have no visible car access were not captured |

### Subtype: BUILDING U/C *(Building under Construction)*

| **Features Captured** | Buildings that were under construction in the imager and had outside walls that clearly indicated the shape of the building were captured. |
| **Capture Notes** |  |
| **Features Excluded** | Under construction buildings were not captured when only the foundation was visible or if the building was being destroyed. |
