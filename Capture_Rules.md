####Introduction<br>
A primary goal of the NYC Citywide GIS is to maintain the accuracy and quality of the base data which includes the orthophotography and planimetrics, collectively known as NYC Map. This base is the foundation upon which virtually all other GIS information within the City of New York is built. Ensuring its completeness and accuracy is fundamental to the Group’s core mission. 
<br><br>
The source imagery was captured on the following dates: <br>• Manhattan - June 24, 2014<br>• The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island - April 1st through April 25th, 2014<br>• Final delivery of all imagery – April 10, 2015<br><br>Using this orthoimagery, the planimetric base layers were updated citywide starting in March 2015 and were completed in February 2016.

# Building Footprints

**Type: Polygon**

**Includes the following structures:** [Building](#subtype-building), [Garage](#subtype-garage), [Under Construction Unknown](#subtype-building-uc-building-under-construction), and [Skybridge](#subtype-skybridge)

### Subtype: BUILDING

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery<br><br>Used existing building database for reference and for BIN values. |
| **Features Captured** | Collected all buildings with well-defined walls and roofs that are >400 sq. feet and taller than 12 feet.<br><br>Buildings with <12 feet height but with BIN were captured.<br><br>Buildings with BIN but <400 sq. feet were captured.<br><br>Buildings with flat roofs were captured on roof outline, capturing the largest outline (excluding overhangs, awnings, construction features, etc.).<br><br>Buildings with pitched roofs were captured on the building footprint.<br><br>Carports, when attached to main building, were included in the outline. Do not collect interior divisions within buildings were not captured (used existing building layer and BIN as guide). |
| **Capture Notes** | Use parcel data and BIN as guidance for collection. Where the parcel data indicates that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is NO physical indication, split the building using the parcel lines. Where the parcel data indicates that a building should be two or more geometries AND there is a physical indication, split the building using the physical indications. If an existing building is going to split into several new buildings, keep the original BIN in only one of the new buildings (ideally the largest) and assign a million BIN to the rest. Do not duplicate BINS.<br><br>Building footprints that are adjacent, have different BINS and are on one tax lot should be flagged and verified during update.<br><br>If a building is demolished (i.e., if the building has a different shape), the BIN is also deleted and is not to be used for any new building geometry.<br><br>Small triangles denote a permit is out to construct a new building at the location and are added by DoITT building editors. These triangles should be removed when new buildings are added. Therefore if a new building has been constructed in the new orthos please collect building, transfer attributes from triangle to building, and delete triangle. If no new building is visible on the orthos, please leave triangles alone (and they will be exceptions in the QC model). |
| **Features Excluded** | The following features are not captured:<br>•  temporary trailers, tents, or roofs at gas stations (over pumps).<br>• roofs (overhang) to gas stations, unless connected to building.<br>• movable jet bridge for access to aircraft<br>• awnings, scaffolds, or sidewalk sheds. |

### Subtype: GARAGE

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Source Databases** | Updated from 2014 imagery<br><br>Used existing building database for reference and for BIN values.<br><br>Used DOF TaxMapas a reference |
| **Features Captured** | CAll garages were captured, regardless of size.  To be considered a garage, the structure must have a driveway (paved or unpaved) for road  access, and be able to store one or more cars. |
| **Capture Notes** | Special care should be applied to ensure sheds are not confused with garages. In general, standard dimensions for detached garages are approximately 12’x20’ or 14’x20’<br><br>Use Parcel layer to place garages within parcel or at parcel boundary – check for special cases where parcel boundary clearly crosses garage. In these cases, either split the garage using physical features, or use the property line where there is no distinguishing physical feature.<br><br>In cases where there is no BIN for the garage, a “dummy” BIN will be assigned as follows:<br>• 1000000 for Manhattan,<br>• 2000000 for Bronx,<br>• 3000000 for Brooklyn,<br>• 4000000 for Queens,<br>• 5000000 for Staten Island |
